Current formats, as we know and like them from other networks, are obligatory. \n\nThe \"leane\" A (narrow) approach, i.e. testing a network prototype as early as possible, should give us a market advantage, since we are not bound to crowdfunding and the expectations that arise from it.\n\nAn important point is also the financial aspect.
