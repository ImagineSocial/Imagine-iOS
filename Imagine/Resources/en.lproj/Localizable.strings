Current formats, as we know and like them from other networks, are obligatory. \n\nThe \"leane\" A (narrow) approach, i.e. testing a network prototype as early as possible, should give us a market advantage, since we are not bound to crowdfunding and the expectations that arise from it.\n\nAn important point is also the financial aspect. Many networks advertise with a freedom from annoying advertising. We are also annoyed by advertising, but we want to make it pleasant and use the enormous financial possibilities. This increases the probability of success and we can give more back to society.";

So when decisions are made, the \"professionals\" have a share in the outcome of the vote.  \nIf, however, the users are not satisfied with the work and decisions of the team, the team's say can be adjusted by periodic elections.\n We will discuss and determine the concept and execution together with the community during the orientation phase of the network.";

If it is possible at a later point in time, they will be compensated for their efforts in an appropriate manner in a joint consensus.\n If the network is successful, a team of employees will be established for the coordinated expansion of the network. For this purpose, the digital network of the setup will be exchanged for a central contact point.  \nCity of the branch office will be selected based on expansion and networking opportunities.\n The helpers at the beginning of Imagine will of course be given a special status for the selection of the team.";
