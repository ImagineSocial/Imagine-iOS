## About

MessengerKit is a drop-in UI for messenger interfaces on iOS built in Swift. Centred around a single `UIViewController`, MessengerKit is themeable to fit your needs and includes a number of powerful features:

- `UICollectionView` based with pre-loading and caching of size calculation for bubbles.
- Auto-growing input view.
- Multiple included cell types: text, large-emoji, image, video.
- Presentation of `SFSafariViewController`
- Built-in, customisable themes.
- A custom theming system to bring your own `UICollectionViewCell`s, headers, footers, and input views.
- Avatar support (currently only in the `travamigos` theme).

The framework was built for and is used in production at [Travamigos](https://travamigos.com).
