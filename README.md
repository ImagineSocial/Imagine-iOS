# Imagine-iOS
The iOS-App in all its glory!

Currently, the iOS version is the prototype of the Imagine Network. We have all the basic network functionalities, like an endless feed, chat,comments & post interactions. The UI is modern and stylish and the performance is very stable. 
You can find the app in the AppStore: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/imagine/id1480679038 

# The Network:
Imagine tries to be a social and entertaining place that encourages a change. A lot of open source and decentralized networks have tried it, so will we. We do not only focus on the serious parts, but try to find a responsible and fun way to get a new network.
We are young and want an up-to-date network without the nasty side effects. We want to give something back and want to build it with the community. Its more fun and effective!

You can find more informations about our ways of diminishing a bad mental state, fake-news/populism and echochambers on our website: www.imagine.social  

# Features:
- *Endless-Feed*: 
Post thoughts, pictures, YouTubeVideos, Links and GIFs (links with .mp4 ending).
Post anonymously.
Upvote the post in four different ways (no downvotes for the social concept see manifesto on website).
Comment on the post (atm in a chat style).
Save posts and see them in a different list.
Repost & translate posts.
Report a post with different options (some of them add a little banner for a vital information to the post).
The feed is last-in, first-out for now. Our goal is to prevent a echo chamber, so this works as long as there are not too many users.

- *User*:
Profiles with name, profile picture, quote and their posts. Display of the name depends of the friendship status. 
Add a User as a friend.
Chat with each other.
Block User to stop interacting with you.

- *Topics*:
Topics are a collection of posts or a discussion topic.
Discussion topics have a display of pro/contra arguments on a single page and are user-content only.
Every argument can have sources and contra arguments if you select it. 
Topic, argument, source and contra argument can be created by a user. 
Topics can be linked to posts (i.e. topics like "cats" but also discussions as "climate change").
You can add optional add-ons for deeper exploration (beta).
Optical reports and discussions are a measure to conter fake-news and populism.

- *Democracy*:
Post your proposals and objections to a open list. 
User can vote for the best ideas.
To keep democracy in and private greed out, we need a lot of help, which you can find in a seperate list in the community area.

- *The Rest*:
FAQ area.
Community chat (like a telegram channel).
Community blog with current actions and statuses.
Two vision pitches.
Info area, where you can dream about the functions and impacts, a truly social and fair network could have.

We use Firebase as a provider for the authentification process, storage and database. This has been a great solution so far.

# so...
there is a lot to do, thats true, but we are here, we already have a working network, there is no kickstarter between us and the market and we will make the necessary additions and changes together. We will find a market fit, gather smart people and keep on working for the change! 

If you are interested to help, you can interact with us via the app, send us a message on Facebook/Instagram, here on GitHub or however you can reach us. We need help in so many areas: UI/UX, Programming (in Kotlin/Java, Swift/ObjectiveC, Javascript...), translations (in english for the beginning)... In short, if you are smart and/or motivated, we are happy for your help!
